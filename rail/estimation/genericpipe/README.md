Repository for FlexZBoost in DESC Pipeline compatible stage

There are two components to the process:
-There is a script named `train_FlexZBoost.py` that takes in a spec-z training file and outputs a pickled model.  When the model/pickle file is loaded, most of the parameter settings can be viewed with [modelname].__dict__

-There is the actual class FlexZPipe that takes the trained model from train_FlexZBoost.py and runs the pipeline stage.  This will be designed to be very similar to BPZPipe for easy comparison.
