# RAIL
Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers

This repo is home to a series of LSST-DESC projects aiming to quantify the impact of imperfect prior information on probabilistic redshift estimation.
RAIL differs from [PZIncomplete](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/pz_incomplete) in that it is broken into stages, each corresponding to a manageable unit of infrastructure advancement, a specific question, and a potential publication opportunity.
By pursuing development of RAIL, we aim to achieve the broad goals of PZIncomplete.

There are four aspects to the RAIL approach, each defined by a minimal version that can be developed further as necessary.
The purpose of each piece of infrastructure is outlined below.

## creation
To forward-model mock data for testing redshift estimation codes

## degradation
To introduce physical systematics in the mock data sets

## estimation
To automatically execute arbitrary redshift estimation codes

## evaluation
To assess the performance of redshift estimation codes
